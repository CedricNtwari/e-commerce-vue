# E-Commerce Platform

An e-commerce platform built using **Vue 3** and **TypeScript**, powered by **Vite** for fast development and build processes. This application showcases a product catalog and shopping cart functionality, designed with modular components for easy maintenance.

## Overview

This project is a desktop(just for now)-oriented e-commerce website that displays a selection of products with options to add items to a cart. While it currently supports a desktop layout, responsive design for tablet and mobile views is planned for future updates.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**: A clean, grid-based layout showing available products with descriptions and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows adding/removing products and viewing items in the cart.
- **Modular Components**: Reusable components for `Header`, `Footer`, `Cart`, and `Shop`.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and enhances code quality.
- **SCSS Styling**: Custom styles in SCSS for a modular and consistent design.
- **Development Powered by Vite**: Fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
